``CAESAR`` leverages yt's `symbolic units
<http://yt-project.org/doc/analyzing/units/index.html>`_.  Every
meaningful quantity *should* have a unit attached to it.  One of this
advantages this provides is that you no longer have to keep track of
little *h* or remembering if you are dealing with comoving or physical
coordinates.

Working with units
==================

Let's take a look at some quick examples of what the units look like,
and how we might take advantage of the easy conversion methods.
Say we have a ``CAESAR`` object with ``obj.simulation.redshift=2`` .
``Caesar`` generally
defaults its length units to be comoving kpc (``kpccm``):

.. code-block:: python

   In [1]: obj.galaxies[0].radii['total']
   Out[1]: 22.2676089684 kpccm

Note the ``cm`` tacked on, which stands for *comoving*.

Because this particular galaxy is at *z=2* we may want to convert that
radius to *physical* kiloparsecs:

.. code-block:: python
                
   In [2]: obj.galaxies[0].radii['total'].to('kpc')
   Out[2]: 7.42253557308 kpc
   
or to physical *kpc/h* (using ``obj.simulation.hubble_constant=0.7``):

.. code-block:: python

   In [3]: obj.galaxies[0].radii['total'].to('kpc/h')
   Out[3]: 5.19577490116 kpc/h

When adding and subtracting quantities, they will be all be converted 
to the units of the first quantity.  You don't have to worry about
homogenizing the units yourself!

Assigning units
===============

Quantities that are added or subtracted must have convertible units.
This means you cannot add a simple number to a quantity with
symbolic units; you must first assign a unit to that number (or
array).

To assign a unit, you can use the yt functions ``YTQuantity`` and ``YTArray``:

.. code-block:: python

   In [4]: from yt import YTQuantity
   In [5]: x = YTQuantity(10, 'Mpc')
   In [6]: print(x.to('kpc'))
   Out[6]: 10000.0 kpc

Similarly, use ``YTArray`` for arrays.  

If you need to get rid of the units and return a value for any reason,
simply append ``.d`` to the quantity:

.. code-block:: python

   In [7]: print(x.d)
   Out[7]: 10
   In [8]: print(x.to('kpc').d)
   Out[8]: 10000.0
